Peer’s project: Branching-plot Novel

What is something you learned by reviewing your peer’s project?

Python is full of subtle and interesting ways of accomplishing a task. I like the use of the f'' string-format structure rather than relying on the format() method.


What is something you saw in your peer’s project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects?

I don't often use the enumerate function; I should be using it all the time



What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?

String formatting is always a little tricky. I would probably recommend multi-line strings (''') instead of trying to stitch everything together with \n and \.
Also, separating the story out from the mechanics of the game often helps with readability. Is there a way to make each node in the story more generalized?



What could have been clearer or better commented?

It was a little tricky to follow the logic of the story from the code. Separating out and grouping the methods might help.




Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?

It was relatively easy to follow.




What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?

The audience for the README.md is anyone who is downloading your source code from github. The README.md currently describes the game, but it doesn't do much to describe to a programmer what he/she should expect from the code.



Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.

This project represents some clever solutions to the problem. It was instructive to me to be able to review your code.
